# Jack's Photo Utilities
**What is Jack's Photo Utilities?**

Jack's Photo Utilities is a small collection of programs that I made to make organizing photos easier. 
This program will get new features *periodically* as I get new ideas or new ideas are suggested and as time permits. 

**How to run:**
- PYTHON: Make sure you have all packages installed, then run the mainWin.py file
- WINDOWS: Run the EXE file

I am going to try to expand what platforms I can create a binary for, but currently
I can only create them for Windows.

**How to build to EXE (with PyInstaller):**
pyinstaller -Fw mainWin.spec
